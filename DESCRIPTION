Description: Implements the phenomonological kinetic model of Chechik and Koller using
  Bayesian priors to facilitate interpretability. Two models can be fit: a sigmoidal model parameterized
  by a half-max time constant, an assymptote and a rate constant, as well as an impulse model which adds
  a second sigmoidal response described by a second time constant and assymptote. Priors enforce
  non-negativity of timing and rate coefficients and with appropriate tuning, focus support on feasible
  parameter ranges. Tensorflow is used to optimize the maximum posterior estimate (MAP) as a combination
  of a non-linear least squares likelihood and priors on kinetic coefficients.
