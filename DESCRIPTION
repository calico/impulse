Description: Implements the phenomenological kinetic model of Chechik and Koller <doi:10.1089/cmb.2008.13TT> using
  Bayesian priors to improve interpretability. Two models can be fit: a sigmoidal model parameterized
  by a half-max time constant, an asymptote and a rate constant, as well as an impulse model which adds
  a second sigmoidal response described by a second time constant and asymptote. Priors enforce
  non-negativity of timing and rate coefficients and with appropriate tuning, focus support on plausible
  parameter ranges. TensorFlow is used to optimize the maximum posterior estimate (MAP) as a combination
  of a non-linear least squares likelihood and priors on kinetic coefficients.
